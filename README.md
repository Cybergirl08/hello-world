This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi there!

I'm [Jessica], a budding developer exploring the world of GitHub and version control.
This repository is part of my journey, to learn the basics of GitHub, including creating
repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

This is my first GitHub repository. Excited and learn and grow!
